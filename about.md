**Data collected includes (but not limited to):**

* Size of browser window in pixels (so we can test to make sure the site displays correctly for all users)
* Browser used (not all browsers support all JavaScript, this helps us to test on what our readers are using)
* Session duration (time spent on the site at a time - giving us an idea of whether people are reading the articles, or using them for reference, etc.)
* Counts of repeat Vs. new users (so we can know if our articles are useful enough to come back)
* Referring site Vs. direct Vs. search traffic (so we can know what methods of spreading the word are working).
